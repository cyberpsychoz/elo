## Problem to solve

It would be nice to have generated js/ruby/sql code pretty printed in the Try
playground.

Yet, I don't want the compiler js bundle to be much bigger because of that.
In other words, not sure it's an compilation option we need to support in core.

## Idea

Any way to add a dev dependency to have pretty printing done in the website
dynamically ?
