## Problem to solve

We must plan for an official 1.0 release. But we have to reach a stable point.

Let's break it down to a feasible plan.

## Idea

Let's prioritize the following items :

- Have a 0.9.x release pipe, ready (github actions that npm publishes)
- I think json must be first class in Elo. So we need to recondider the null
  question (literal and type) and have basic support for arrays
- We need to cross check that the stdlib is powerful enough, and make necessary
  improvements
- I think we need a way to execute elo files easily, and reconsider the Try page
  to have the Run feature more first-class.
- What else ? A pass of /sceptic maybe ?
