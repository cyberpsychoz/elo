## Problem to solve

Now that we have Tuples and Datapaths, I'd like to make sure we have the stdlib
that allows maniputalting them easily (immutable, though).

## Idea

* Check that the stdlib contains necessary functions to manipulate complex data
  structures easly, using Datapath where they help.
* Complete stdlib with missing functions.
* Take it as an opportunity to check the whole stdlib for completeness and
  consistency.
