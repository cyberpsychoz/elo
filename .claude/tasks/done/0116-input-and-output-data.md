## Problem to solve

Elo is a input->output data language, our recent work on playground shows it
more clearly.

It would actually be nice to be able to take other data formats as input and
as output. JSON, CSV and XLSX come to mind.

## Idea

Let's see how to improve our various runtimes (`bin/elo` and web's `Playground`)
so that it's natural to take various data formats as input, and output result
in various data formats as well.
