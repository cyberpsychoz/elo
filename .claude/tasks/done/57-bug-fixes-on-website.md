## Problem to solve

Three bug fixes:

- burger menu is broken on mobile
- on mobile, the blog posts lack horizontal space. You should at least reduce
  layout padding somehow.
- when clicking on a menu entry (learn, reference, stdlib) page is properly
  scrolled to the correct anchor/title. But the title has no vertical space
  above it, it sticks to the header.
